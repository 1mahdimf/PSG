#          CLASH META - UNIVERSAL TEMPLATE
# --------------------------------------------------
# This template is structurally correct and efficient for both
# Clash and Clash.Meta clients. It avoids repetition by using
# the 'use' keyword, which is a Clash.Meta feature. Standard
# Clash clients will simply ignore it and fall back to the full
# proxy list where it's defined.
